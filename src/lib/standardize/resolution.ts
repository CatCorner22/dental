// FIX-OR-ATTEST: the resolution model for everything the transformer catches.
//
// The governing rule, stated once: THE TOOL NEVER AUTO-CORRECTS AND THE USER
// NEVER OVERRIDES. Every concern the pass raises must end in exactly one of:
//
//   FIXED     — the user edited the text and a re-run no longer raises it.
//   REVIEWED  — for the deterministic rewrites only: a human read the
//               itemised change and accepted it. The rewrite was language-
//               only, but "language-only" is this module's claim, and a claim
//               nobody checks is how the NKA→NKDA class of bug shipped.
//   ATTESTED  — the user states, in real words, why the flagged text is
//               correct as written. Same substance bar as the PHI override:
//               friction plus a named record is the enforceable part.
//   ESCALATED — the user genuinely disagrees with the RULE, not the catch.
//               That is not an override: the disagreement goes to a Team Lead
//               (a rule-disagreement wish) for final resolution, and the
//               record of it survives either way.
//
// Nothing leaves the tool while a blocking concern is open. That is the whole
// jidoka posture: the line stops, the reason is stated in cold logic, and the
// person is given the exact ways forward.
