// The Mockingbird gates: the checks that stop a note from proceeding when the
// medication content, as written, matches a documented pattern of serious
// harm. Named for what happens when nobody stops the line.
//
// THE HARD BOUNDARY, same as plausibility.ts and not negotiable: nothing in
// this file computes, converts, or suggests a dose, and nothing here gives
// prescribing advice. Every finding says "this combination or construct is a
// documented error pattern — a clinician confirms it or fixes it." The moment
// a documentation tool proposes a dose or a drug decision it is a clinical
// decision-support system with a different regulatory posture.
//
// Sources for the patterns (cited in the message so staff learn WHY, not just
// WHAT — a rule whose reason is visible is a rule that gets respected):
//  - Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert 39 / ISMP: weigh and dose in
//    kilograms; the lb-as-kg confusion is a documented 2.2x overdose path.
//  - Pediatric dosing literature: tenfold errors from misplaced decimals;
//    household spoons vs oral syringes.
//  - SDCEP Drug Prescribing for Dentistry + peer-reviewed dental
//    pharmacology: the short list of interactions that recur in dental
//    prescribing (warfarin, lithium, epinephrine with non-selective
//    beta-blockers, statins with macrolides/azoles).
