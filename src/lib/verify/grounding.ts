// THE FABRICATION GUARD.
//
// The verifier this sits beside was built to catch SUBSTITUTION: a changed dose,
// a swapped drug, a dropped negation. It did that well and it was blind to the
// other half of the problem. A red-team probe of fifteen attacks got fifteen
// through, and the ones that mattered were all the same shape — the model did
// not alter anything, it ADDED something:
//
//   "Composite placed on tooth 19."
//     -> "... Occlusion was checked and adjusted. The patient tolerated the
//         procedure well."
//   "Extraction of tooth 17 completed."
//     -> "... Risks and alternatives were discussed and consent was obtained."
//   "Examined the lower arch."
//     -> "... Findings were within normal limits."
//
// Every one passed: no digits changed, no drug named, no negation touched, no
// attribution lost, and the output was LONGER so the shrink guard had nothing to
// say. That is not a gap in the checks, it is a missing category of check. It is
// also the exact failure mode that turns a documentation assistant into a
// liability generator, because each of those sentences is a claim a plaintiff's
// expert would read aloud and no clinician ever made.
//
// So: nothing in the output may assert what the input did not. The tractable
// form of that is lexical grounding — every clinical word the model writes must
// trace back to a word the writer typed, or to the practice's own standard
// vocabulary, or it is an invention.
//
// TWO TIERS, because one threshold cannot serve both jobs:
//
//   Tier 1 names the words whose fabrication is independently unacceptable
//   ("consent", "uneventful", "reviewed"). One is enough to refuse.
//
//   Tier 2 catches whole invented sentences built from words that are individually
//   innocent. It asks what fraction of a sentence's content is grounded, which
//   lets ordinary grammar repair through ("pain x3 days" -> "pain lasting 3
//   days" introduces "lasting" and keeps everything else) while refusing a clause
//   that shares almost nothing with the note.
//
// The asymmetry is deliberate and is the whole thesis. Refusing a good rewrite
// costs a staff member one click and shows them a reason. Accepting a fabricated
// one puts a sentence nobody wrote into a legal and medical record. Those are
// not comparable, so this errs hard toward refusal, and every refusal names the
// specific words that caused it so a false alarm is diagnosable rather than
// mysterious.
