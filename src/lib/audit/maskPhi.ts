// Replace a flagged identifier with a random opaque pseudonym.
//
// The screen already tells a clinician "this looks like an identifier." Until
// now the only ways forward were retype it by hand or waive the stop, and
// under time pressure between patients the waiver is the path of least
// resistance. That is a bad default for the one gate the whole PII-free
// premise rests on. This gives them a third option that takes one click and
// leaves the note MORE de-identified than before.
//
// WHAT A GOOD PSEUDONYM HAS TO BE, and why each property is load-bearing:
//
//  1. RANDOM, not derived. A mask computed FROM the identifier — a hash, a
//     cipher, initials, a birth year — is a pseudonym that still carries the
//     original inside it. Anyone holding the same function can recover or
//     confirm the value, and under HIPAA a re-identifiable code is still
//     protected data. `crypto.getRandomValues` has no relationship to the
//     input, so there is nothing to reverse and no key to leak.
//
//  2. CONSISTENT WITHIN ONE NOTE. If "John Smith" appears three times it must
//     become the same token all three times, or the note stops making sense —
//     a reader cannot tell whether two masked mentions are one person or two.
//     Consistency comes from a per-note map built at mask time, NOT from
//     deriving the token from the text.
//
//  3. NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS NOTES. Deliberate, and the reason this is not a
//     hash. A token stable across every note in the practice becomes a durable
//     patient key: link enough masked notes on [PERSON-A7K2] and the set
//     re-identifies someone even though no single note does. A fresh random
//     token per note keeps each note an island.
//
//  4. OBVIOUSLY A MASK. `[PERSON-A7K2]` cannot be mistaken for clinical text
//     or for a real chart number, and it survives the round trip into Curve
//     Hero as something a human immediately reads as redacted.
//
// This never runs by itself. It is offered to the clinician, applied to the
// fields they choose, and the audit re-runs afterwards on the real text.
