// Smile Notes tells staff the same rules in two places, and they were kept in
// step by hand:
//
//   /reference/terminology   renders the markdown below, hand-typed.
//   /reference/abbreviations renders the TypeScript tables, generated.
//
// Nothing compared them. The coupling existed only as a comment at the top of
// each vocab module saying it "mirrors" the markdown, which is a promise with
// no enforcement — so the two pages could disagree in production and no test
// would fail.
//
// They HAD diverged, and in the direction that matters most. `U`, `IU`, and
// `MS / MSO4 / MgSO4` — the Joint Commission "Do Not Use" entries, the ones
// that exist because "10U" gets read as "100" — were added to the code and
// never reached the staff-facing table. A hygienist reading the terminology
// page was told the tool checked a smaller set than it does. In the other
// direction the markdown promised a check on "large" that was never
// implemented, which is worse: the tool claimed a safety net it did not have.
//
// This test compares the TERM SETS in both directions. It deliberately does
// NOT compare the guidance prose — a compact table cell and a findings-panel
// suggestion are allowed to be worded differently, and forcing them to match
// would push toward duplicating strings rather than keeping the lists honest.
