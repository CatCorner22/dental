// Robotic-assisted implant surgery (Yomi / Neocis-class haptic guidance and
// dynamic-navigation systems).
//
// The legal shape of this record, and the reason every field below exists: in
// a passive-guidance model THE SURGEON operates and the robot constrains. A
// note that reads as "the robot placed the implant" is wrong twice — it
// misstates the device's FDA-cleared role, and it hands a plaintiff's
// attorney the theory that the practice delegated surgery to a machine. So
// the record must show: what was planned, that the system was registered and
// calibrated, what was actually achieved, every deviation and every human
// override, and that the surgeon remained in control throughout.
//
// Planned-vs-actual is the heart of it. A deviation is not a defect — brains
// override plans for live anatomy all the time — but an UNDOCUMENTED
// deviation reads as either carelessness or concealment, and a records
// reviewer cannot tell which.
