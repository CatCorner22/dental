// BYTE'S BRAIN — the advisory knowledge base.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT BYTE IS, AND WHAT BYTE IS NOT
//
// Byte is the practice's knowledge, compiled: Tennessee dental-record law, the
// pharmacy safety literature, claim-file documentation patterns (see
// knowledge/sources/litigation-documentation-research.md), and the practice's
// and the practice's own writing standards — evaluated deterministically
// against the note being drafted, live, on every pause in typing.
//
// Byte is READ-ONLY AND ADVISE-ONLY, structurally. There is no code path from
// this module to a note: it consumes text and returns advice objects, and the
// UI that renders them contains no write action. The human is in control at
// all times, not as a policy but as an architecture — Byte could not touch the
// record even if every rule below were wrong.
//
// Byte is also NOT the audit. The audit engine gates; findings block or advise
// with severities and it owns enforcement. Byte coaches: WHY the standard
// exists, which case or rule it comes from, and what a stronger note looks
// like. Same tables, same facts, different job — the audit is the referee,
// Byte is the trainer. Byte never blocks anything, ever.
//
// EVERY ENTRY CITES ITS SOURCE. Advice without a source is one person's
// opinion wearing a mascot costume; advice with "Tenn. Comp. R. 0460-02-.12"
// or "Schwarcz, Mich. Ct. App. 2015" under it is the practice's institutional
// knowledge, teaching itself to whoever is typing.
