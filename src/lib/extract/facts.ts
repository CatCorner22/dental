// CLINICAL FACTS — what a note SAYS, as structure rather than prose.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE INVARIANT THAT GOVERNS THIS ENTIRE DIRECTORY
//
//   EXTRACTION IS READ-ONLY. Nothing here returns text. Nothing here edits a
//   note. Every value below is either a span pointing INTO the input or a
//   value derived from a controlled table.
//
// That is not a style preference, it is the reason this layer is allowed to
// exist at all. `standardize.ts` carries a hard contract — a rewrite is either
// deterministic-language-only or it is handed back to a human — and the fastest
// way to break it would be a component that "understands" a note and helpfully
// rewrites it. So this component cannot rewrite anything. It reads, and it
// hands back an index.
//
// Everything downstream (the odontogram, the consistency rules, the coverage
// meter) is therefore a VIEW of the note. If the view is wrong, the note is
// unchanged and the worst case is a wrong picture next to correct text. If we
// had let extraction write, the worst case would be a wrong legal record.
// ===========================================================================
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now the transformer was text-to-text: it substituted
// words, reordered sentences, and flagged problems. That is a real ceiling.
// A text-to-text engine cannot answer "which teeth did this visit treat?",
// which means it cannot draw a chart, cannot notice that tooth 14 was both
// extracted and restored, and cannot check that the prose agrees with the
// structured fields. Every one of those is downstream of having FACTS.
//
// REFUSAL IS THE DEFAULT. A clause that does not parse produces nothing. There
// is no repair, no guess, no partial-credit interpretation. The measured parse
// rate is allowed to be low and to grow; what is not allowed is a fact the note
// did not state. This mirrors the vocabulary tables' refusal to expand an
// ambiguous abbreviation, and it is the same reasoning.

 * 1. TEMPORALITY IS A HINT, NEVER AN ASSIGNMENT. ConText's published recall on
 *    "historical" is 67.4% and its precision 74.2% — the authors say plainly
 *    that doing it properly "requires knowledge above and beyond the surface
 *    clues" the algorithm sees. In a dental note the historical/current line is
 *    the line between charting someone else's old crown and billing for a new
 *    one, so a 67%-recall guess is worse than no guess. We surface the cue and
 *    let a human decide.
 *
 * 2. NEGATION IS ASSIGNED, because there the same algorithm measures 97%/97%,
 *    and because the failure it prevents is the one that matters most here: an
 *    extractor that reads "no caries #14" as a caries finding would paint a
 *    tooth the note explicitly called clean.
