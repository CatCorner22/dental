//     "Root canal therapy (RCT) was started. The RCT was completed at the
//      second visit."
//
// That is how a note stays readable to someone who was not in the operatory —
// an insurer, a specialist, an attorney, a colleague covering a shift — without
// forcing the writer to spell out the same phrase six times. It is the standard
// convention in medical and legal writing, and it is what makes a note survive
// being read years later by someone who does not share your habits.
//
// AMBIGUOUS ENTRIES ARE NEVER EXPANDED. Several of these initialisms mean more
// than one real thing in a dental chart: GP is gutta-percha and general
// practitioner; CR is composite resin and centric relation; ASA is a nerve
// block and an anesthesia risk classification. Guessing would put a clinical
// claim in the note that the writer never made, so those carry `alternatives`
// and are surfaced for the writer to resolve.
//
// DOSING FREQUENCIES follow the ISMP error-prone abbreviation list. The ones
// with a single unambiguous reading are expanded; "qd" and "qod" are NOT,
// because they are confused with each other and with "qid" in real handwriting
// and that confusion has caused real dosing errors.

  // ss, cc, APAP, D/C — is in BANNED_ABBREVIATIONS as a do-not-use flag instead,
  // because expanding a dangerous abbreviation LAUNDERS it: the note comes out
  // clean and the habit that caused the error survives untouched.

  // read without pause by an insurer, an attorney or the next treating dentist,
  // so defining them adds noise rather than clarity — ".5 mg intravenous (IV)"
  // is worse writing than ".5 mg IV". An existing dose-safety test caught it by
  // asserting the exact output of a sedation line, which was the right alarm for
  // the wrong reason and still the right answer.

  // DOSING INTERVALS (q4h, q6h, q8h, q12h) live in BANNED_ABBREVIATIONS instead,
