// The composer walks modules in canonical order, so every note comes out in
// the same standardized sequence no matter how it was entered.
// Empty optional fields are omitted: a blank never silently becomes normal,
// and required blanks surface as audit findings instead.

// Neutralize markdown structure in user-entered free text so a typed
// "## Submission record" can never forge a heading, a table, or a code fence
// in the frozen note or audit report — the real stamp uses those exact
// markers, and the frozen .md is EMAILED as an attachment and opened in real
// markdown viewers, which is where a forgery would be believed.
//
// This used to escape leading "#" within 0-3 spaces, plus runs of 3+ -*_.
// That is an allowlist of two against a grammar with a dozen block starters,
// and it lost five ways, every one of them typable into an ordinary textarea:
//
//   FOUR SPACES   the escape window was 0-3, so one more space walked past it
//                 - and inside the "- Label:" list item the extra indent put
//                 "##" at relative column zero, a genuine H2.
//   SETEXT        "Submission record" then "--" is an H2 in pure markdown.
//                 The old rule needed 3+ dashes; a setext underline needs one.
//   RAW HTML      nothing escaped "<" at all.
//   <!--          an UNTERMINATED comment erases the entire rest of the
//                 document: the allergy block, the diagnosis, the plan, and
//                 the genuine Submission record all vanish from the rendered
//                 attachment while the file still "contains" them.
//   FENCES        an unterminated ``` or ~~~ swallows the rest as sample code,
//                 which works even in renderers that strip HTML.
//
// So the rule is inverted: escape anything that can START a block, and escape
// "<" everywhere. Ordinary prose and real bullet lists are left alone — a
// leading "- " with content after it is a list item and harmless; what is
// escaped is a line made ONLY of underline/rule characters.
