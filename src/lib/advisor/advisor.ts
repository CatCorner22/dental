// THE ADVISOR ENGINE — Byte's read of a note in progress.
//
// Deterministic, client-side, and fast enough to run on every pause in typing:
// one extraction pass (measured ~1 ms) plus table lookups. No network, no
// model, no storage — the note never leaves the keyboard it is being typed on.
//
// The engine returns three things and the UI may not add a fourth:
//   ADVICE  — the highest-priority knowledge entries whose predicates match.
//   GAUGES  — live numbers a drafting screen can draw: how much of the note
//             the tools can read, how dense it is, how much anesthetic
//             headroom remains, and which later-reader pillars are present.
//   MOOD    — which face Byte makes. Derived from the same numbers, because a
//             mascot whose expression disagrees with the dashboard is a
//             mascot nobody trusts.

 *
 * They used to be called the defensibility pillars, and the rename is the point
 * rather than tidying. This code counts which of four things a note MENTIONS. It
 * cannot know whether a note would survive scrutiny, and a name asserting
 * otherwise invites a clinician to read four ticks as a verdict on their record.
 * What is actually true is smaller and still worth saying: a reader who arrives
 * later, with no memory of the visit, will look for these four and will not find
 * them if they are absent.
 *
 * Presence-only — never a score, because a percentage invites gaming and a
