// PUBLIC CHAPTER 1107 (2026) — the supervision rule with a start date.
//
// From January 1, 2027, a dental hygienist must be under DIRECT supervision of
// a dentist who has seen a NEW patient before completing any of: diagnostic
// radiographs, assessment and recording of hard- and soft-tissue data,
// prophylaxis, or fluoride application.
//
// The owner's blueprint says to implement this as an effective-dated validation
// rule NOW rather than leave the date to staff recollection after it arrives,
// and that is the right call: the one thing software is reliably better at than
// people is remembering that a rule changes on a Thursday five months from now.
//
// HOW THE DATE ENTERS WITHOUT BREAKING DETERMINISM. Every other rule in this
// engine is a pure function of the note, and a rule that read the wall clock
// would quietly end that: the same note would audit differently on two days,
// and property tests could never pin it. So the audit date is an INPUT —
// AuditContext.today, defaulting to the real date at the call site — and the
// tests exercise both sides of January 1, 2027 by passing the date in.
//
// BEFORE the effective date, the risky combination raises an S4 advisory, not
// silence: the practice is five months out as this ships, and the cheapest
// time to change a scheduling habit is before the law starts caring. After the
// date it is S1 — it blocks filing, per the blueprint's hard-stop table.
