// REGRESSION: the first-use expansion destroyed plural counts.
//
// "SSCs placed on teeth A and B" became "stainless steel crown (SSC) placed
// on teeth A and B" — ONE crown documented for TWO teeth. PR #19 fixed this
// for second occurrences (applyPlural on the display), but the FIRST
// occurrence still replaced a plural token with a singular multi-word
// expansion, because applyPlural refuses to pluralise a phrase. A count is a
// billing and legal fact; these tests pin the plural-preserving expansion
// (Shorthand.pluralExpansion) so the bug cannot return.
