 * "radiograph". That is right for the clinical record and exactly backwards for
 * a paragraph the patient reads, where the plain-language rule is at the same
 * moment asking for "radiograph" to become "x-ray".
 *
 * Without this the panel would show both findings at once, each undoing the
 * other, and the writer would have no way to satisfy the tool. The suppression
 * is narrow on purpose: only STYLE abbreviations, and only when the matched
 * text appears nowhere in the clinical half of the note. A word used in both
 * halves keeps its finding, because there it really is about the record.
 *
 * The suppressed set holds the finding OBJECTS, not composite string keys. An
 * earlier version joined ruleId and matchedText with a separator, and the
 * separator that got committed was a literal NUL byte — which made git treat
 * this whole file as binary and refuse to merge it textually. Identity is what
 * the filter actually needs here, since every candidate came out of the array
 * being filtered, so there is no key to encode and nothing to get wrong.
