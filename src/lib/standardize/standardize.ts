// Paste-to-standard: the "writing on rails" pass, moved out of the companion
// skill and into the app.
//
// THE GOVERNING SPLIT, and the reason this module is worth reading before
// changing: a rewrite is either DETERMINISTIC or it is a JUDGEMENT CALL, and
// those two must never be mixed.
//
//   APPLIED — the replacement is fixed, language-only, and adds no clinical
//   claim. "x-ray" is always "radiograph". "abcess" is always "abscess".
//   Nothing about the patient changes; only the wording does.
//
//   FLAGGED — the correct replacement needs facts that the shorthand is
//   hiding. "PA" could be a periapical radiograph or a posteroanterior
//   cephalometric one. "tolerated well" needs the observed response. A
//   medication-name typo could be two different drugs. Guessing here would
//   invent clinical content, so the tool refuses and asks.
//
// Two rules fall out of that split and are enforced by tests:
//   1. A medication-name typo is NEVER auto-corrected, even though it sits in
//      the same misspelling table as everything else. "amoxicilin" is almost
//      certainly amoxicillin — but "almost certainly" is not a standard a drug
//      name is allowed to be corrected on.
//   2. Nothing here writes a clinical assertion, adds a finding, or removes a
//      negation. The output says exactly what the input said, in standard words.
//
// The result is a PROPOSAL. The person reads the itemised list and chooses to
// accept it. That is what keeps "no suggestion is ever auto-applied" true while
// still making this a one-click tool.
