// CONTEXT — is this fact asserted, denied, hypothetical, or about someone else?
//
// An implementation of the ConText algorithm (Chapman, Chu & Dowling, BioNLP
// 2007; extended by Harkema et al., J Biomed Inform 2009), which is itself the
// generalisation of NegEx (Chapman et al., J Biomed Inform 2001). Pure token
// matching against three declarative term tables. No model, no training data,
// no statistics — every decision traces to a named entry in a table below, and
// the entry's id is carried on the result so a finding can say WHICH WORD
// decided it rather than "the system thought so".
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHY THIS SHIPS WITH THE EXTRACTOR AND NOT AFTER IT
//
// An extractor without an assertion layer is not a weaker version of one with
// it — it is a hazard. "No caries #14" and "caries #14" tokenize almost
// identically, so a naive extractor reports a caries fact for a tooth the note
// explicitly called clean, and the odontogram paints it. The chart would then
// contradict the record it was drawn from, which is worse than having no chart.
// ===========================================================================
//
// THE MEASURED NUMBERS, and what we do differently because of them.
//
//   Negation      97% recall / 97% precision  -> ASSIGNED
//   Hypothetical  82.5% / 94.3%               -> hinted
//   Historical    67.4% / 74.2%               -> hinted
//   Experiencer   50% / 100% (n=8)            -> hinted
//
// Only negation clears the bar for being decided automatically. The rest are
// surfaced as cues for a human, because in a dental note the historical/current
// distinction is the difference between charting someone else's old crown and
// claiming for a new one, and a 67%-recall guess about that is not a feature.
//
// KNOWN FAILURE MODES, taken from the papers' own error analyses and storm-
// tested in context.test.ts:
//   - a trigger landing between two words of one concept ("chest wall is
//     without tenderness")
//   - relative clauses killing scope early via a terminator
//   - double negatives and genuine human ambiguity
//   - the commonest cause by far: a trigger nobody put in the table
//
// The last one is why an UNRECOGNISED construct must never become an affirmed
// fact by default in a place where that is dangerous. It is handled at the call
// site in extract.ts, not here.
