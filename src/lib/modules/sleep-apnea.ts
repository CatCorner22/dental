// Oral appliance therapy for sleep-disordered breathing.
//
// A whole service line that previously had two words of coverage — "sleep" as
// one option in an Oral Medicine select. That is not enough to record a therapy
// whose defensibility rests on facts a dentist does NOT generate: the diagnosis
// and the sleep study belong to a physician, and the dentist treats on referral.
//
// So the first section is about somebody else's findings, and every field in it
// asks who said so. A note that reads as though the dental practice diagnosed
// sleep apnoea is a note describing an act outside the practice of dentistry.
