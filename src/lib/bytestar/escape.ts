// ByteStar is allowed to adjust ONLY its own suggestion ranking and wording.

// probe for the killswitch, a request for PII, or an instruction to ignore the
// rails is refused HERE, before a human ever sees it, and logged as
// `bytestar.escape` so Team Lead can see the attempt in the clear.
//
// The model is never told these patterns exist. Telling a model the shape of
// its cage is how cages get tested.
